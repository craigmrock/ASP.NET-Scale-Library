# ASP.NET-Scale-Library
Library of music scales with .NET Razor Pages App


Context: I needed to continue to build on my experience with .NET after learning more about implementing security, and connecting to my Neo4j database with .NET.
Action: I created a scale library with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages as a foundation. 
Result: When I was first ran the app complete with an intro-sized bit of data, I was very happy with the results and efficiency of creating it.
Reflection: I am more interested in using .NET for my projects now than ever before. It has revealed a bit of a fork in the road for me, when before the path was only java and microservices.
